-->As I have completed the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp, I have gained experience in Python,  SQL and Databases. This now stands me in good stead to continue the next step of the path in this new career choice. My previous employment history has given me the drive to succeed and a keen eye for detail in anything I do. With skills such as problem solving, communication, working under extremely tight deadlines and under strict regulations and quality assurance. Also having such attention to detail when deploying software or dealing with customers and internal software systems, I feel I am already set up to work well in any environment I am asked. 
I invite you to look at every bit of the code I have so proudly written so far.

Thank you for looking!
